Higher level languages such as /R/ and /Python/ are easy and quick to write, though they are slow when executed[fn:1].  Lower level languages[fn:2], such as /C/ and /C++/ take more time to write, but create binaries which are considerably faster when executes.  So often high level languages are used to prototype an idea, but once you know what you want to do it is implemented in a lower level language.

* Footnotes
[fn:2]High and low level means how far the code is from the machine.  Think of the machine as the base.  Higher level languages are farther from the machine than lower level languages. 

[fn:1]Often writing the code is the major speed bottleneck, and so in this sense high level languages can be very 'fast'.
